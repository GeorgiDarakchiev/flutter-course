## Homeworks

#### Theme 1

- Setup your development environment - [Flutter docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
  - install flutter
  - install android studion and setup a emulator
  - [MAC ONLY] install xccode and setup a simulator
  - install your IDE of choicec - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- Create and run your first flutter app
- Change the text of the default label - `You have pushed the button this many times:` - to be `Click count`
- *Add one more label below the counter label that is showing the clicked count multiplied by 10 (e.g. if you clicked the button 2 times the new label should show 20)

#### Theme 2
- Create a flutter application
- Modify the application - preserve the idea of a Counter app and simply use a different layout. It is all up to you - you can also use different widgets (not only Text).
- Write 2-3 Widget tests for your Counter app. If you are intereseted you can try to write some integration tests (driver) as well.
